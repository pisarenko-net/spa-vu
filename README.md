DIY Digital/analog input/output switch and Spectrum Analyzer.

The goal of this project is to build a physical appliance to switch among analog and digital audio inputs, with a built-in spectrum analyzer, in the spirit of 80's Hi-Fi. I am going to use as many ready-made components and rely on as many available services (e.g. to machine a front-panel) as possible.

With a little collection of decks and vintage Hi-Fi devices I cannot wire them once and for all because my minidsp SHD preamp does not have enough inputs. I also like the appearance of vintage 80s devices, with their physical interfaces and little spectrum analyzers. Nothing like this exists, either modern or vintage. I saw https://imgur.com/a/7NiOgrQ?nc=1 once and got inspired to build something in the same spirit.

The secondary goal is education: learning electronics, soldering and DIY. Never done anything like this before.

This is work in progress.
